**🤷‍♂️ The reason for our existence**


Nowadays it is easy to access practically any type of information🕵️‍♂️📈, whatever the topic of your interest, there is probably a course👨‍🏫, a master class👩‍⚖️, or at least some articles online📝. However, we do not always need theory ⚠. What we often end up looking for🔍 is an authentic experience 👨‍🔬, we need answers that are adapted to our questions ⚙ and that are prepared by people 👩🏿‍🤝‍🧑🏻 who have learned it the hard way 💪.


**🎯 Where are we going**


ConeXperto aims to be a social network 💻 to learn and grow 🚀. We believe that people learn best from other people 👥, it was like
that for a long time⏲ and this is how we actually learn from our environment. In the future and today 🤖.

We will have to constantly learn otherwise we run the risk of being left behind 📸 and obsolete 🗑. 

Today we learn primarily from people in our close social circles: friends🧑, family👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 and colleagues👨‍💼. With us 👋, the goal is to create a platform that allows anyone to learn from another anywhere in the world🌐 and expand our learning possibilities🤝 beyond close social circles. 



**🛠 What we need**

We need people👩‍💻👨‍💻 who trust what we do 🤝 and help us build ⚒ the platform to give as many people as possible access to real life knowledge📚 by learning from each other 👌.
